# http-server

A http server I wrote from scratch in Go. The HTTP protocol is pretty poorly implemented. Currently supports GET and POST. You have to write your own handlers, I'm not bundling those right now.

To run: `go test`, I'm too lazy to write an actual program with this lol

**No SSL support, it is not planned**
