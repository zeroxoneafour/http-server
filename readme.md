# http-server

A http server I wrote from scratch in Go. The HTTP protocol is pretty poorly implemented. You have to write your own handlers, I'm not bundling those right now.

Running `go test` starts a very plain server with the ability to get files. That is all.

**No SSL support, it is not planned**
